## Branching Notes

This will list ways to ceate and manage branches.

`git branch` - lists branches you have locally and indicates the one your're on

`git branch BRANCH_NAME` - create a new branch called BRANCH_NAME

Befor you intend to merge a branch, pull from `master` locally.

Make sure you pull from origin master locally when you merge on git hub.
